# Lindenmayer system

Inspired by the algorithmical beauty of trees.

# Generate LSystem parser

```
$ ./node_modules/pegjs/bin/pegjs -O speed lsystem.pegjs && mv lsystem.js src
```

This parser can parse either lstrings or entire axiom definitions.

# Quirks and howto:s

Test out your own L systems using my system. The idea is to
make the "turtle" move along a fractal. One can change the
length and width of the marks as well as the angle of travel.
There are some functions available to make this happen.

| Function            | Description             | Type          |
| -------------------:| -----------------------:| -------------:|
| mov(length, width)  | Move in the direction   | Part of axiom |
| rot(degrees)        | Change direction        | Part of axiom |
| [                   | Push state on stack     | Part of axiom |
| ]                   | Pop state from stack    | Part of axiom |
| cos(x), sin(x)      | Trigonometric functions | Argument expression |
| context(0)      | Return number of drawings, needed to accomplish animation | Argument expression |
